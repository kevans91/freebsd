The following user-visible changes have occurred in this branch:
- Packets are now correctly staged for processing once the handshake has
  completed, resulting in less packet loss in the interim.
- Various race conditions have been resolved, particularly w.r.t. socket and
  packet lifetime (panics)
- Various tests have been added to assure correct functionality and tooling
  conformance.
- if_wg has become vnet-friendly
- if_wg now maintains the semantics observed on Linux with net namespaces;
  notably, sockets are created in the interface's home vnet so that it can
  act as the sole network connection for a jail
- if_wg no longer fails to remove peer allowed-ips of 0.0.0.0/0
- if_wg now exports via ioctl a format accepted and supported by the upstream
  wireguard-tools
- if_wg now conforms to the WireGuard protocol and is more closely aligned with
  the upstream security auditing guidelines
